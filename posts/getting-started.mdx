## Authorization

---

### Step 1

Once you‚Äôve decided to use the best **companion** on Discord, you can continue by inviting it to your favorite server!

![invite discord bot](/posts/Images/GetStarted/invite.png)

Click the `Select a server` button. A pop-up will appear allowing you to choose where you‚Äôd like to add Musik.

### Step 2

After selecting the server you want to add Musik to, click the `Continue` button at the bottom right of the menu.

You should see a screen similar to this:

![invite discord bot](/posts/Images/GetStarted/invites.png)

<div
  style={{
    backgroundColor: '#313338',
    padding: '10px',
    borderRadius: '10px',
    color: '#ffffff',
    marginBottom: '5px',
  }}
>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If you want to disable the `Administrator` permission
  from Musik, it will not work properly! You will still be able to use basic
  music features, but some functionalities may not work.
</div>

### Final Step

After clicking the `Authorize` button and completing the Captcha, you will be redirected to our thank-you page. Additionally, you should see a welcome message in your Discord server. **Awesome!**

Now, let‚Äôs get the party started by playing some songs
