**Welcome to the guide on integrating Last.fm with Musik! With this feature, you can automatically scrobble the music you're listening to and keep track of your listening habits.**

## How to Connect Your Last.fm Account

To connect your Last.fm account, use the following command:

- ### `/login`

After typing the command, you will receive a link button. Click the link to authorize Musik with your Last.fm account. Follow the prompts to grant access to Musik for scrobbling your music.

If you don't have a Last.fm account, you can [sign up here](https://www.last.fm/join) to create one. The sign-up process is quick and easyâ€”just provide a username, password, and email address.

## Scrobbling Your Music

Once your account is connected, Musik will automatically scrobble the tracks you listen to. Scrobbling will occur 1 minute after the track starts playing, so your listening history is accurately recorded on Last.fm.
